Msc2gen is a simple translator from MSC textual representation format (event-oriented, standardized by ITU-Z.120) into mscgen textual representation.

Usage
=====

Type in command line:

    msc2gen <in_file.msc> <out_file.mscgen>

Example of input MSC file ``stop_and_wait.msc``:

    msc msc_stop_and_wait;
        Sender   : instance;
        Receiver : instance;
        
        Sender   : in 'sEnv(buffer)' from env;
        Sender   : out 'sFrame(buffer =: frData)' to Receiver;
        Receiver : in 'sFrame(buffer =: frData)' from Sender;
        
        Receiver : out 'rEnv(frData)' to env;
        
        Receiver : out rFrame to Sender;
        Sender   : in  rFrame from Receiver;
        
        Sender   : endinstance;
        Receiver : endinstance;
    endmsc;

and the output file:

    # This file was generated by msc2gen tool.
    msc {
        Sender, Receiver;
        
        Sender note Sender [label="from_env{ sEnv(buffer) }"];
        Sender->Receiver [label="sFrame(buffer =: frData)"];
        Receiver note Receiver [label="to_env{ rEnv(frData) }"];
        Receiver->Sender [label="rFrame"];
    }
